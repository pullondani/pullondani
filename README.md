Hi!

My name is Daniel, I am currently working as a Web Developer for HortPlus and studying full time in my final year of a Software Engineering degree with Honours.

I am hoping to find a role as a full time Software Developer. I am hoping to find a role somewhere I can grow my strengths and understanding.

In my GitHub repository I currently have some small personal projects alongside projects I completed during my studies.

I'm happy to discuss if you have any questions or would like to talk further. 

Thank you for reading!
