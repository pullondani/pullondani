Hi!

My name is Daniel, I am currently working as an Analyst Developer for FNZ.

In my GitHub repository I currently have some small personal projects alongside projects I completed during my studies.

I'm happy to discuss if you have any questions or would like to talk further. 

Thank you for reading!
